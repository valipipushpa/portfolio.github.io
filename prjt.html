       Low Power VLSI Implementation of 32-point FFT
    </p>
    <h3><u>DESCRIPTION</u>:-</h3>
    <p>
        Power and Speed are the two crucial design parameters in any integrated circuit design. With increasing development
         in the field of VLSI, there is a need of high-speed devices that consumeless power.
         The FFT is employed in the field of Digital Signal Processing (DSP) like filtering,spectral analysis and 
         so on. The FFT plays a vital role in Digital communication such as  digital video broadcasting.
          It is an algorithm to compute Discrete Fourier transform. The Discrete
          Fourier Transform is one of the most common operations in the field of signal processing.
        The algorithm for computing the DFT effectively known as Fast Fourier Transform. <br>FFT is used to transform a 
        signal from time domain to frequency domain. FFT is made of complex addition and multiplication. This project aims to design 
        such a low power architecture for the FFT implementation. In this project we would like to implement FFT for a 32-point input sequence with Decimation in Time (DIT) for
         Radix-2 algorithm. The coding for our proposed architecture will be done in Verilog and simulated using ModelSim 10.5b.
